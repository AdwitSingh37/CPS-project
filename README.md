# CPS-project
This is the CPS project made by: Shreyas(24750), Mahima(24732), Dishitha(24713) and Adwit(24704)
It is a contact directory that allows you to add a contact, remove a contact, display all the contacts and search for a particular contact.
The data is stored as a CSV file. Data structures like list, dictionary and strings have been used to organize the information.  
This project also has a fun element involved, a function named fun_statistics that represents graphically the most common digit in a phone number.
