# CPS-project
This is the CPS project made by: Shreyas, Mahima, Dishitha and Adwit
It is a contact directory that allows you to add a contact, remove a contact, display all the contacts and search for a particular contact.
This project also has a fun element involved, a function named fun_statistics that represents graphically the most common digit in a phone number.
